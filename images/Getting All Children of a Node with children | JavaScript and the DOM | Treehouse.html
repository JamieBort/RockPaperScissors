                    Along with the other properties
we've studied so far,
                    <span class="time">0:00</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="3" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=3">
                    you can also get all children elements
of a node with the children property.
                    <span class="time">0:03</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="7" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=7">
                    Similar to previous element sibling and
next element sibling,
                    <span class="time">0:07</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="11" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=11">
                    children will return only HTML elements.
                    <span class="time">0:11</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="14" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=14">
                    So let's have a look at our list app.
                    <span class="time">0:14</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="16" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=16">
                    And see how we can make use
of the children property.
                    <span class="time">0:16</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="19" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=19">
                    You may have noticed,
that when you add a new item to the list,
                    <span class="time">0:19</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="23" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=23">
                    no buttons are placed on that item.
                    <span class="time">0:23</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="26" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=26">
                    So this means that it can't be
moved through the list or removed.
                    <span class="time">0:26</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="29" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=29">
                    So let's fix this issue while
introducing a new feature.
                    <span class="time">0:29</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="31" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=31">
                    Let's add the buttons entirely
with Javascript to begin with.
                    <span class="time">0:31</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="35" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=35">
                    So that our HTML doesn't need to
have those button elements at all.
                    <span class="time">0:35</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="38" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=38">
                    First, let's go to index.html and
delete all the buttons.
                    <span class="time">0:38</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="52" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=52">
                    Now, let's have a look at app.js, and try
to get a sense of what we need to do here.
                    <span class="time">0:52</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="56" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=56">
                    So when a user clicks the button,
to create a new list item,
                    <span class="time">0:56</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="60" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=60">
                    this handler at the bottom runs.
                    <span class="time">1:00</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="63" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=63">
                    It creates the new list item,
sets the text, and appends it to the dom.
                    <span class="time">1:03</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="67" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=67">
                    So somewhere in here,
we need to create three buttons and
                    <span class="time">1:07</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="71" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=71">
                    append them to the list item.
                    <span class="time">1:11</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="73" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=73">
                    But before we just write that
directly into this handler, remember,
                    <span class="time">1:13</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="76" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=76">
                    we don't just need to do this for
new list items.
                    <span class="time">1:16</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="79" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=79">
                    We also need to create
those same buttons for
                    <span class="time">1:19</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="81" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=81">
                    any list items that are already
present when the page loads.
                    <span class="time">1:21</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="85" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=85">
                    So for this reason, it makes sense
to write a separate function
                    <span class="time">1:25</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="88" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=88">
                    that can work in both of these cases.
                    <span class="time">1:28</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="91" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=91">
                    So up top, let's write a function
that accepts a list item.
                    <span class="time">1:31</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="95" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=95">
                    And attaches the needed buttons to it.
                    <span class="time">1:35</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="98" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=98">
                    Under the element selections,
let's declare a function.
                    <span class="time">1:38</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="101" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=101">
                    I'm going to call it attachListItemButtons
to be clear about what it does.
                    <span class="time">1:41</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="110" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=110">
                    And it's going to accept
a list item as a parameter.
                    <span class="time">1:50</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="113" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=113">
                    So we'll pass the function li.
                    <span class="time">1:53</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="117" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=117">
                    And first in our function,
let's declare the three buttons for
                    <span class="time">1:57</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="121" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=121">
                    up, down, and remove.
                    <span class="time">2:01</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="123" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=123">
                    So we'll start with let up
= document.createElement.
                    <span class="time">2:03</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="132" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=132">
                    And we'll pass the string button.
                    <span class="time">2:12</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="136" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=136">
                    I'll go ahead and copy this variable.
                    <span class="time">2:16</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="137" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=137">
                    Paste the new one right below and change
it to let down create element button.
                    <span class="time">2:17</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="145" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=145">
                    And I'll paste the new one below that and
we'll call this one remove.
                    <span class="time">2:25</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="151" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=151">
                    Next, let's add the appropriate classes
and text content to each button.
                    <span class="time">2:31</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="156" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=156">
                    So first, say up.className = 'up'.
                    <span class="time">2:36</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="165" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=165">
                    And then, we'll say,
up.textcontent = 'Up'.
                    <span class="time">2:45</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="171" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=171">
                    I'll go ahead and copy these two
properties and paste them in for down.
                    <span class="time">2:51</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="178" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=178">
                    And I'll just change these
two down className.down.
                    <span class="time">2:58</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="183" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=183">
                    And down.textContent = 'down'.
                    <span class="time">3:03</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="193" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=193">
                    And I'll do the same for remove
                    <span class="time">3:13</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="207" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=207">
                    And finally, let's append each
button to the list item element.
                    <span class="time">3:27</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="211" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=211">
                    So for up, we'll say li.appendChild(up).
                    <span class="time">3:31</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="224" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=224">
                    And for down, I'll say,
li.appendChild(down).
                    <span class="time">3:44</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="228" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=228">
                    And then, li.appendChild(remove).
                    <span class="time">3:48</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="238" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=238">
                    And now, down in our add item handler,
                    <span class="time">3:58</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="241" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=241">
                    we can call our new function
on the new list items.
                    <span class="time">4:01</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="248" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=248">
                    So in the handler, we'll say,
attachListItemButtons and
                    <span class="time">4:08</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="254" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=254">
                    pass in a (li).
                    <span class="time">4:14</span>

                    All right, so let's save our file, and go
over to the browser, and see if it works.
                    <span class="time">4:17</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="261" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=261">
                    I'll refresh and
all the buttons are gone now.
                    <span class="time">4:21</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="265" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=265">
                    But when we add a new item,
we see that the three buttons are present.
                    <span class="time">4:25</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="271" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=271">
                    And clicking them, we can verify,
they work the way we'd hope, nice.
                    <span class="time">4:31</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="278" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=278">
                    So now, let's add the buttons
to the existing list items.
                    <span class="time">4:38</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="282" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=282">
                    I'll store the button
in the constant list.
                    <span class="time">4:42</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="284" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=284">
                    And select them using
the children property.
                    <span class="time">4:44</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="291" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=291">
                    Then, below the new function, we can
loop through the list item elements.
                    <span class="time">4:51</span>
</a>                  <a class="block" data-seek-video="296" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-all-children-of-a-node-with-children?t=296">
                    Calling our attachListItemButtons
function on each one.

                    Let's save app.js and
have a look in the browser.

                    l'll refresh the page and great.

                    It looks like our buttons are added.
